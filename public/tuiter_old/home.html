        Nobita Nobi (野比 のび太のび のびた Nobi Nobita), known simply as Noby (a possible diminutive of his Japanese name) in the American and UK versions, is the main protagonist of the Doraemon franchise. He was a failure of a person until Doraemon came from the 22nd century to aid him so he could have a better future in life.
            Nobita is a rather lazy person who has a cycle of constantly napping after school, keeping him up late when he wakes up late for school. This cycle of laziness occurs almost every day, keeping him up late at night and wake up late the next morning, hindering him academically. Nobita is very dependent on Doraemon and begs for multiple things, much to his disapproval. Many things that Nobita wishes for include; vengeance on his bullies, a better product than what Suneo brags about, and privileges.

            Shizuka Minamoto is the only female character who appears in Doraemon Series. she is kind and caring, likes dolls. Shizuka is nice to everybody, including nobita. shizuka is very smart, though not up to dekisugi's level.
            she is slim, has a light skin color, black eyes and her hair is usually dark in color and tied up in short pigtails. She usually wears a pink dress.
            She cares for weaker people, abused animals and neglected dolls. She wishes to be a nurse or an air-hostess when she grows up. Both jobs reflect her kind nature. Shizuka loves her dolls a lot, to the extent that she loves them more than her own friends. She once freed a little bird from a bundle of strings it got caught in. She also cares deeply for the Grandfather Tree. When she was unable to save the Grandfather Tree, she was devastated but later felt relieved when she saw a little sprout from the Grandfather Tree stump
