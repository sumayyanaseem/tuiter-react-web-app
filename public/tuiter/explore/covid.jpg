People who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with the COVID-19 virus should avoid close direct contact with animals, including farm, zoo or other captive animals, and wildlife.<br/><br/><strong>Companion animals</strong><br/>There is no evidence that companion animals are playing an epidemiological role in the spread of human infections of SARS-CoV-2. However, as animals and people can both be affected by this virus, it is recommended that people who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 virus avoid close contact with their companion animals and have another member of their household care for them. If they must look after their companion animals, they should maintain good hygiene practices and wear a face mask, if possible. Animals belonging to owners infected with COVID-19 virus should be kept indoors in line with similar lockdown recommendations for humans applicable in the country or area. There is no justification in taking measures which may compromise the welfare of companion animals.<br/>As a general good practice, basic hygiene measures should always be implemented when handling and caring for animals. This includes hand washing before and after being around or handling animals, their food, or supplies, as well as avoiding kissing, being licked by animals, or sharing food.<br/><strong>Farmed animals</strong><br/>Handling farmed animals susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 can carry additional risks when large numbers of animals are kept in close contact.

This was the first time that the virus has been detected at population levels in wildlife. This discovery requires further research to determine if white-tailed deer could become a reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 and to assess other animal or public health implications.\u00a0 While there is currently no evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from white tailed-deer to humans, there appears to have been multiple introductions of the virus into white-tailed deer populations by humans.

The OIE is closely liaising with its network of experts involved in current investigations on the source of the disease. Rumours and unofficial information are also monitored daily.<br/>The OIE has mobilized several expert groups (\u2018<em>ad hoc</em> groups\u2019) to provide scientific advice on research priorities, on-going research, and other implications of COVID-19 for animal health and veterinary public health, including risk assessment, management, and communication. Several guidance documents developed by the OIE and its network of experts are available <a href=\"https://www.woah.org/en/what-we-offer/emergency-and-resilience/covid-19/#ui-id-4\">here</a>.<br/>Given the similarities between COVID-19 and the emergence of other zoonotic diseases at the human-animal interface, the OIE is working with its Wildlife Working Group and other partners to develop a longer term work programme which aims to better understand the dynamics and risks around wildlife trade and consumption, with a view to developing strategies to reduce the risk of future disease spillover events.<br/>The OIE is also reviewing lessons learned from COVID-19 to fortify its institutional resilience to international crises. To this end, the OIE has undertaken two after action reviews and has initiated a work stream aimed at building institutional resilience to all threats (irrespective of the cause).","inLanguage":"en-GB"},"inLanguage":"en-GB"}]}</script>

<p class="align-justify">The unprecedented nature of this pandemic and the mysteries around this new virus have required innovative approaches to tackle it. At a time when much uncertainty remains and much work still needs to be undertaken to understand how the virus emerged and entered the human population, one certainty abides: collaboration across sectors is key to respond to this crisis.</p>
<p class="align-justify">WOAH has been intensively working with its network of experts and liaising closely with its Members to better understand the virus and its emergence and to enhance the capacity of countries to respond to this multifaceted crisis. The activities of Veterinary Services contribute to addressing critical needs, such as food supply, which are heavily challenged in the current circumstances. In these times where solidarity is more important than ever, Veterinary Services have also been supporting the response capacity of human health services in various ways.</p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator" />
<h2 class="align-justify">A coordinated and scalable response mechanism</h2>
<p class="align-justify">Through its mission to set animal health and welfare standards, to inform and to build capacity, the World Organisation for Animal Health is fully mobilised to support the work of its partners and to accompany Veterinary Services across the world to address the situation.</p>
<p class="align-justify">WOAH established an <strong>Incident Management System</strong> to coordinate its response to COVID-19 internally and with external key partners such as the World Health Organization (WHO). <a href="https://www.woah.org/en/what-we-offer/emergency-and-resilience/covid-19/#ui-id-4"><br><strong>Read more</strong></a></p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />
<h2>A multisectorial approach</h2>
<p class="align-justify">The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a new evidence that a longstanding and sustainable One Health collaboration is needed. From the start of the crisis, existing Tripartite frameworks for emergency management have been used. WOAH has participated in the WHO’s International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee regarding the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and WOAH experts have supported the WHO R&D blueprint, which is a global plan that allows the rapid and coordinated activation of research and development activities.</p>
<p>Beyond collaborative research activities, the animal health sector has contributed in various ways towards building a common response to the pandemic in the field. The veterinary profession has shown its commitment to support the work of human health authorities. Whether for the provision of testing capacity by animal health laboratories, through donating essential materials such as personal protective equipment and ventilators, or through direct provision of human resources and expertise, Veterinary Services have greatly contributed to support the international and national response to COVID-19.<br><a href="https://www.woah.org/en/what-we-offer/emergency-and-resilience/covid-19/#ui-id-5"><strong>Discover some examples</strong></a></p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator" />
<h2>Planning ahead</h2>
<p class="align-justify">COVID-19 has disrupted our present time so much that it has sent shockwaves into the future, creating greater fragments of uncertainty but also space for innovation. We are not quite sure what the future holds but we know that we can influence the future through active preparedness. The World Organisation for Animal Health must anticipate and prepare for challenges and opportunities to better adapt its operations and support its membership.</p>
<p class="align-justify">WOAH has been preparing for an event like COVID-19 for several years. Pandemic preparedness and biological threat reduction have been high on the agenda, leading to the establishment of mechanisms such as OFFLU (which would respond to an influenza pandemic of animal origin), a biological threat reduction strategy (supported by two global conferences) and several projects which are supporting capacity building for emergency management and improved sustainability of laboratories.</p>
<p class="align-justify">WOAH has a track record of responding to disease emergence at the human animal interface, having mobilised for H5N1 avian influenza (‘Bird Flu’); Pandemic H1N1; MERS; and H7N9 zoonotic avian influenza.</p>
<p class="align-justify">When the WOAH was restructured in January 2020 to notably include foresight and a Preparedness and Resilience Department, it was to take into account global change which is reshaping our environment, in terms of climate, human behaviours and land use, for example. </p>
<p class="align-justify">WOAH will use foresight to guide its approach – an applied set of methodologies to consider possible future outcomes or “futures”. Foresight is not a means of forecasting or predicting the future. Rather it is a means of acknowledging numerous possible futures, some of which we have a hint of given information available today and allowing the opportunity to be better prepared to address a future made of multiple eventualities. Our collective will and coordinated action remain essential to ensure the OIE and our Members’ Veterinary Services contribute to a better and safer future.</p>

<p><strong>[Last updated: 31 January 2022]</strong></p>
<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1653131852155"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What causes COVID-19?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">COVID-19 is the disease caused by a coronavirus (CoV) named SARS-CoV-2. They are called coronaviruses because of their characteristic ‘corona’ (crown) of spike proteins which surround their lipid envelope. Coronavirus infections are common in both animals and humans, and some strains of coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted between animals and humans.<br /><br />In humans, coronaviruses can cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as <a href="https://www.woah.org/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/MERS-CoV/Q_A_MERS-CoV_EN_update_Jan2019.pdf">Middle East Respiratory Syndrome</a> (caused by MERS-CoV), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (caused by SARS-CoV). Detailed investigations have demonstrated that MERS-CoV was transmitted from dromedary camels to humans and SARS-CoV from civets to humans.<br /><br />In 2019, a new coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of human cases of pneumonia by Chinese Authorities. Rapid international spread of human cases led to COVID-19 being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Investigations have not yet  identified the origin of the virus. For up-to-date information on the human health situation consult the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">WHO website</a>.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1653131930912"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Are animals responsible for COVID-19 cases in people?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">The current pandemic is being sustained through human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 emerged from an animal source. Genetic sequence data reveals that the closest known relatives of SARS-CoV-2 are coronaviruses circulating in <em>Rhinolophus</em> bat (Horseshoe Bat) populations. However, to date, there is not enough scientific evidence to identify the source of SARS-CoV-2 or to explain the original route of transmission to humans, which may have involved an intermediate host.<br /><br />Animal infections with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in a range of species by a number of countries. Evidence suggests that these infections have been introduced following contact with infected humans see XXX for further information.<br />There is little evidence that animals have infected humans, with the exception of isolated incidents on mink farms where farm workers were in close contact with infected mink.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1653131974321"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Can animals be infected with SARS-CoV-2?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Yes, a broad range of mammalian species have demonstrated susceptibility to the virus through experimental infection, and in natural settings when in contact with infected humans. There is also evidence that infected animals can transmit the virus to other animals in natural settings through contact, such as mink to mink transmission, mink to cat transmission, and transmission among populations of white-tailed deer including vertical transmission to their offspring.<br /><br /> Infection of animals with SARS-CoV-2 has implications for animal and human health, animal welfare, wildlife conservation, and biomedical research. However, not all species appear to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. To date, findings from experimental infection studies show that poultry, swine and cattle are resistant to infection and do not shed the virus.  <br /><br />It is possible that we may see changes in the susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease as the virus continues to evolve and new variants emerge.<br /><br />Up to date information on the susceptibility of different animal species can be found  <a href="https://www.woah.org/en/document/oie-technical-factsheet-infection-with-sars-cov-2-in-animals/">here</a>.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1653132444024"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What are the implications of animal infections with SARS-CoV-2?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Although a broad range of animal species have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 with varying clinical manifestations, these infections are not the driver of the current COVID-19 pandemic, which is human-to-human transmission.<br /><br />There is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals has a significant impact on human health, animal health, or biodiversity. However, it is sensible to continue to monitor the potential impacts of SARS-CoV-2 at the human-animal-environment interface.<br /><br />There are concerns about the establishment of SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs in wild or domestic animals, which could pose risks to animal and public health. Although mink and white-tailed deer have been infected at the population level there is no evidence that an animal reservoir has been established. Further studies will be required to assess the possibility for establishment of an animal reservoir and to assess implications for human and animal health.<br /><br />There is also a possibility for the virus to evolve through animal infections, leading to the emergence of new variants which may behave differently from existing strains.<br /><br />By monitoring animals for SARS-CoV-2 infections and working closely with other sectors (e.g., the public health sector, wildlife sector, environmental sector) it will be possible to assess implications of animal infections for human and animal health.<br /> <br />More information about the SARS-CoV-2 events in animals reported by countries to the OIE can be found <a href="https://www.woah.org/en/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus/events-in-animals/">here</a>.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1653132466809"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What do we know about COVID-19 and mink?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Farmed mink are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and, in some cases, they have transmitted the virus back to humans. Surveillance findings in Denmark and the Netherlands show that SARS-CoV-2 introduced into mink populations continues to evolve through viral mutation. Viral mutation also happens in human infections, but new mutations may be seen as the virus adapts to a new species. Scientific investigations have confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reintroduced from mink to humans.<br /><br />The OIE acknowledges that such events could have important public health implications. There are concerns that the introduction and circulation of new virus strains in humans could result in modifications of transmissibility or virulence and in decreased treatment and vaccine efficacy. Yet, the full consequences remain unknown, and further investigation is needed to fully understand the impact of these mutations.

People who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with the COVID-19 virus should avoid close direct contact with animals, including farm, zoo or other captive animals, and wildlife.<br /><br /><strong>Companion animals</strong><br />There is no evidence that companion animals are playing an epidemiological role in the spread of human infections of SARS-CoV-2. However, as animals and people can both be affected by this virus, it is recommended that people who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 virus avoid close contact with their companion animals and have another member of their household care for them. If they must look after their companion animals, they should maintain good hygiene practices and wear a face mask, if possible. Animals belonging to owners infected with COVID-19 virus should be kept indoors in line with similar lockdown recommendations for humans applicable in the country or area. There is no justification in taking measures which may compromise the welfare of companion animals.<br />As a general good practice, basic hygiene measures should always be implemented when handling and caring for animals. This includes hand washing before and after being around or handling animals, their food, or supplies, as well as avoiding kissing, being licked by animals, or sharing food.<br /><strong>Farmed animals</strong><br />Handling farmed animals susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 can carry additional risks when large numbers of animals are kept in close contact. Risk management strategies depend on the species and the circumstances under which the animals live and are cared for. Refer to the specific <a href="https://www.woah.org/en/document/guidance-on-working-with-farmed-animals-of-species-susceptible-to-infection-with-sars-cov-2/">OIE guidance</a> for further recommendations.<br /><strong>Wildlife</strong><br />A wide range of mammalian species may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The OIE has developed <a href="https://www.woah.org/fileadmin/Home/eng/Our_scientific_expertise/docs/pdf/COV-19/A_WHSG_and_OIE_COVID-19_Guidelines.pdf">guidelines</a> for people engaged in wildlife work in the field to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.<br />Recent scientific research has shown a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection within white-tailed deer populations in North America. This was the first time that the virus has been detected at population levels in wildlife. This discovery requires further research to determine if white-tailed deer could become a reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 and to assess other animal or public health implications.  While there is currently no evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from white tailed-deer to humans, there appears to have been multiple introductions of the virus into white-tailed deer populations by humans. People should avoid leaving any human waste or objects in forested areas that may be ingested or touched by wild animals.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1653132591298"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What precautionary measures should be taken when visiting markets selling live animals, raw meat and/or animal products?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Although there is uncertainty about the origin of SARS-CoV-2, in line with WHO recommendations, general hygiene measures should be applied when visiting markets selling live animals, raw meat and/or animal products. These measures include regular hand washing with soap and potable water after touching animals and animal products, as well as avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth. Precautions should be taken to avoid contact with sick animals, spoiled animal products, other animals present in the market (e.g., stray cats and dogs, rodents, birds, bats) and animal waste or fluids on the soil or surfaces of market facilities. Standard recommendations issued by WHO to prevent spread of the infection amongst humans include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose with the elbow when coughing and sneezing and avoiding close contact with any person showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. Further recommendations from WHO can be consulted <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus">here</a>.<br /><br />As per general good food hygiene practices, raw meat, milk, or animal products should be handled with care, in particular to avoid potential cross-contamination from uncooked foods to foods which are ready to eat. Meat and meat products, and milk and milk products from healthy livestock that are prepared and served in accordance with good hygiene and food safety principles remain safe to eat.<br /><br />The Codex Alimentarius Commission has adopted several practical guidelines on how to apply and implement best practices to ensure food safety, which can be consulted on the <a href="http://www.fao.org/fao-who-codexalimentarius/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Codex website</a>.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1653132605566"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What can national Veterinary Services do?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Veterinary Services should work closely with Public Health authorities and those responsible for wildlife using a One Health approach to share information and cooperate in the response to COVID-19. Close collaboration between animal and public health authorities is imperative to better identify and reduce the impact of this disease.<br /><br />Close collaboration between several sectors including animal health, public health, wildlife authorities, environment, and academia will be required to better understand the short, mid, and long term implications of SARS-CoV-2 at the human-animal-environment interface.<br /><br />In some countries, Veterinary Services have supported core functions of the public health response, such as screening and testing of surveillance and diagnostic samples from humans. OIE Guidance on Veterinary Laboratory Support to the Public Health Response for COVID-19 is available <a href="https://www.woah.org/fileadmin/Home/eng/Our_scientific_expertise/docs/pdf/COV-19/A_Guidance_for_animal_health_laboratories_1April2020.pdf">here</a>. Veterinary clinics in some countries have also supported the public health response by donating essential materials such as personal protective equipment and ventilators.<br />Veterinary Services should be considered as <a href="https://www.woah.org/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/covid-19-and-veterinary-activities-designated-as-essential/">essential services</a>. National authorities can advocate for this within COVID-19 response plans and operations, to ensure a continuum in the activities related to animal health, animal welfare and veterinary public health, under appropriate protocols.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1653132619663"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What can Veterinary Services do to protect susceptible animals, such as mink and white-tailed deer?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Veterinary Services should protect animal health and welfare, and consequently public health, by implementing effective risk management measures to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between humans and susceptible animals.<br />Monitoring susceptible animals, such as mink, racoon dogs and white-tailed deer as well as humans in close contact with them, for SARS-CoV-2 infection is important. Active monitoring is recommended as it is difficult to detect early infections in these animals. More information can be found in the <a href="https://www.woah.org/en/oie-statement-on-monitoring-white-tailed-deer-for-sars-cov-2/">OIE Statement on monitoring white-tailed deer for SARS-CoV-2</a>.<br />When a person infected with COVID-19 virus reports being in contact with animals, a joint risk assessment should be conducted by Veterinary and Public Health Services. If a decision is made to test animals as a result of this risk assessment, it is recommended to use RT-PCR to test oral, nasal and/or fecal/rectal samples.  The risk assessment may also recommend to carry out a full genome sequencing of the virus isolated from animals. Measures should be taken to avoid contamination of specimens from the environment or by humans.<br /><br />Animals that have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 should be kept away from unexposed susceptible animals. For further recommendations, refer to the OIE guidelines for people working with susceptible <a href="https://www.woah.org/fileadmin/Home/MM/Draft_OIE_Guidance_farmed_animals_cleanMS05.11.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">farmed animals</a>, as well as with wild mammals in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1653132637508"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What are the Veterinary Services international responsibilities in the event of positive animal cases?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">The infection of animals with SARS-CoV-2 meets the OIE criteria of an <a href="https://www.woah.org/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=glossaire.htm#terme_maladie_emergente" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emerging disease</a>.

The OIE is closely liaising with its network of experts involved in current investigations on the source of the disease. Rumours and unofficial information are also monitored daily.<br />The OIE has mobilized several expert groups (‘<em>ad hoc</em> groups’) to provide scientific advice on research priorities, on-going research, and other implications of COVID-19 for animal health and veterinary public health, including risk assessment, management, and communication. Several guidance documents developed by the OIE and its network of experts are available <a href="https://www.woah.org/en/what-we-offer/emergency-and-resilience/covid-19/#ui-id-4">here</a>.<br />Given the similarities between COVID-19 and the emergence of other zoonotic diseases at the human-animal interface, the OIE is working with its Wildlife Working Group and other partners to develop a longer term work programme which aims to better understand the dynamics and risks around wildlife trade and consumption, with a view to developing strategies to reduce the risk of future disease spillover events.<br />The OIE is also reviewing lessons learned from COVID-19 to fortify its institutional resilience to international crises. To this end, the OIE has undertaken two after action reviews and has initiated a work stream aimed at building institutional resilience to all threats (irrespective of the cause).</p> </div> </div>

<p class="align-justify"><strong>In the framework of the Incident Management System, several expert <em>ad hoc</em> Expert Groups have been established. </strong></p>
<p class="align-justify">Under the leadership of the<strong> <a href="https://www.woah.org/en/what-we-do/standards/standards-setting-process/working-groups/working-group-on-wildlife/">Wildlife Working Group</a></strong>, WOAH mobilised an expert group to provide scientific advice and to develop guidelines on a range of topics linked to human-animal-ecosystems interface aspects of COVID-19. These include identifying research priorities, communicating results of on-going research in animals, developing scientific opinions on the implications of COVID-19 for animal health and veterinary public health, and providing practical guidance for Veterinary Services. Subsequently an expert group was established to assess the <strong>risks and implications of COVID-19 for safe trade in animals and animal products.</strong></p>
