<h2> Nobita </h2>
@WebDev
<p>
    Nobita Nobi (野比 のび太のび のびた Nobi Nobita), known simply as Noby (a possible diminutive of his Japanese name) in the American and UK versions, is the main protagonist of the Doraemon franchise. He was a failure of a person until Doraemon came from the 22nd century to aid him so he could have a better future in life.
    Nobita is a rather lazy person who has a cycle of constantly napping after school, keeping him up late when he wakes up late for school. This cycle of laziness occurs almost every day, keeping him up late at night and wake up late the next morning, hindering him academically. Nobita is very dependent on Doraemon and begs for multiple things, much to his disapproval. Many things that Nobita wishes for include; vengeance on his bullies, a better product than what Suneo brags about, and privileges.
